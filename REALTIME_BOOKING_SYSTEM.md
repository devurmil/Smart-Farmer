# Real-Time Booking System Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of a real-time booking system that allows instant updates between farmers and equipment owners without requiring page refreshes.

## Problem Solved
- **Before**: When a farmer booked equipment, the owner had to refresh their page to see new bookings
- **Before**: When an owner approved/rejected a booking, the farmer had to refresh to see status changes
- **After**: All booking updates are reflected in real-time on both sides

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Server-Sent Events (SSE) Endpoint
**File**: `backend/routes/booking.js`
- Added `/api/booking/stream` endpoint for SSE connections
- Maintains a global map of connected clients (`global.sseClients`)
- Each user gets a unique SSE connection based on their user ID

#### 2. Real-Time Notifications in Booking Controller
**File**: `backend/controllers/bookingController.js`

**Events Added**:
- `new_booking`: Sent to equipment owner when a new booking is created
- `booking_created`: Sent to farmer when their booking is successfully created
- `booking_approved`: Sent to farmer when their booking is approved
- `booking_rejected`: Sent to farmer when their booking is rejected
- `booking_completed`: Sent to farmer when their booking is completed
- `booking_cancelled`: Sent to both parties when a booking is cancelled
- `booking_updated`: Sent to both parties for general booking updates

**Functions Updated**:
- `createBooking()`: Sends notifications to both farmer and owner
- `approveBooking()`: Sends notifications to both parties
- `declineBooking()`: Sends notifications to both parties
- `completeBooking()`: Sends notifications to both parties
- `cancelBooking()`: Sends notifications to both parties

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. SSE Hook
**File**: `src/hooks/useSSE.ts`
- Custom React hook for managing SSE connections
- Automatic reconnection on connection loss
- Event handling for different booking status updates
- TypeScript support with proper interfaces

#### 2. User Bookings List
**File**: `src/components/UserBookingsList.jsx`
- Integrated SSE hook for real-time updates
- Shows notification messages for booking status changes
- Automatically refreshes booking list when updates are received
- Visual feedback for all booking events

#### 3. Owner Equipment List
**File**: `src/components/OwnerEquipmentList.jsx`
- Integrated SSE hook for real-time updates
- Shows notification messages for new bookings and updates
- Automatically refreshes equipment and booking data
- Real-time updates for booking management actions

#### 4. Equipment Booking Modal
**File**: `src/components/EquipmentBookingModal.jsx`
- Enhanced success message to indicate real-time notification
- Better user feedback about the booking process

## How It Works

### 1. Connection Establishment
1. When a user logs in, the SSE hook automatically establishes a connection
2. Connection is maintained using the user's authentication token
3. Each user gets a unique SSE stream based on their user ID

### 2. Booking Creation Flow
1. Farmer submits booking request
2. Backend creates booking in database
3. Backend sends `new_booking` event to equipment owner
4. Backend sends `booking_created` event to farmer
5. Both parties receive real-time notifications
6. Both pages automatically refresh to show updated data

### 3. Booking Approval/Rejection Flow
1. Owner approves/rejects booking
2. Backend updates booking status in database
3. Backend sends appropriate event to farmer
4. Backend sends update event to owner
5. Both parties receive real-time notifications
6. Both pages automatically refresh to show updated data

### 4. Booking Cancellation Flow
1. Farmer cancels booking
2. Backend updates booking status
3. Backend sends cancellation events to both parties
4. Both pages automatically refresh

## Benefits

### For Farmers
- Immediate feedback when booking is created
- Real-time status updates (approved/rejected/completed)
- No need to refresh page to see booking changes
- Better user experience with instant notifications

### For Equipment Owners
- Immediate notification when new booking is received
- Real-time updates when managing bookings
- Instant feedback when approving/rejecting bookings
- Better management of equipment availability

### Technical Benefits
- Scalable SSE implementation
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Type-safe TypeScript implementation
- Clean separation of concerns
- Minimal performance impact

## Testing the System

### 1. Test Booking Creation
1. Log in as a farmer
2. Book equipment from another user
3. Verify that the owner's page shows the new booking immediately
4. Verify that the farmer's page shows the booking confirmation

### 2. Test Booking Approval
1. Log in as an equipment owner
2. Approve a pending booking
3. Verify that the farmer's page shows the approval notification immediately
4. Verify that the owner's page shows the update

### 3. Test Booking Rejection
1. Log in as an equipment owner
2. Reject a pending booking
3. Verify that the farmer's page shows the rejection notification immediately

### 4. Test Booking Cancellation
1. Log in as a farmer
2. Cancel a pending booking
3. Verify that the owner's page shows the cancellation notification immediately

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **SSE Connection Fails**: Check if backend server is running
2. **No Real-time Updates**: Verify user authentication
3. **Connection Drops**: System automatically reconnects after 5 seconds
4. **Notifications Not Showing**: Check browser console for SSE errors

### Debug Information
- SSE connection status is logged to browser console
- All events are logged with their data
- Connection errors are logged with details
- Reconnection attempts are logged

## Future Enhancements
- Push notifications for mobile devices
- Email notifications as backup
- WebSocket implementation for bi-directional communication
- Notification preferences for users
- Real-time chat between farmers and owners

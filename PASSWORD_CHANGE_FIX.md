# Password Change Fix for Admin Page

## Problem
When changing any user's password through the admin page, users couldn't login with the new password.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **double hashing** of passwords:

1. The backend route (`/api/users/:id`) was manually hashing passwords using `bcrypt.hash(password, 12)`
2. The User model already has a `beforeUpdate` hook that automatically hashes passwords when they change
3. This resulted in the password being hashed twice, making it impossible to login

## Solution

### Backend Changes (`backend/routes/users.js`)

1. **Removed manual password hashing** from the UPDATE route:
   ```javascript
   // Before (causing double hashing)
   if (password) user.password = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);
   
   // After (let the model handle hashing)
   if (password && password.trim() !== '') {
     user.password = password; // Model hook will hash this
   }
   ```

2. **Removed manual password hashing** from the CREATE route:
   ```javascript
   // Before (causing double hashing)
   const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 12);
   const newUser = await User.create({ name, email, phone, password: hashedPassword, role });
   
   // After (let the model handle hashing)
   const newUser = await User.create({ name, email, phone, password, role });
   ```

3. **Added password validation** to ensure passwords are at least 6 characters long

### Frontend Changes (`src/pages/AdminPage.tsx`)

1. **Added success message state** to show when password changes are successful
2. **Improved user feedback** with specific messages for password changes
3. **Enhanced placeholder text** to make it clear that leaving the field blank keeps the current password
4. **Added proper error/success message clearing** when modals are closed

## How It Works Now

1. **Admin enters a new password** in the edit user form
2. **If password field is empty**, the current password is preserved
3. **If password field has content**, it's sent to the backend
4. **Backend validates** the password length (minimum 6 characters)
5. **User model's `beforeUpdate` hook** automatically hashes the password
6. **User can now login** with the new password

## Testing

To test the fix:
1. Login as admin
2. Go to Admin Page
3. Edit any user
4. Change their password
5. Try logging in with the new password - it should work now

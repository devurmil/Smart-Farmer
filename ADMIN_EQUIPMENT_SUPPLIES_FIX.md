# Admin Page Equipment and Supplies Display Fix

## Problem Description
The admin page was not showing equipment and supplies details for users when clicking the "View Content" button. The modal would open but display "No equipment found" and "No supplies found" even when users had equipment and supplies.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the frontend data parsing in the `AdminPage.tsx` component. The code was incorrectly trying to access:
- `equipData.data?.equipment` (should be `equipData.data`)
- `supplyData.data?.supplies` (should be `supplyData.data`)

The backend APIs return the data directly in the `data` field, not nested under additional properties.

## Backend API Response Formats

### Equipment API (`/api/equipment?user_id={userId}`)
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: [equipment1, equipment2, ...], // Array of equipment objects
  total: count,
  page: 1,
  limit: 10
}
```

### Supplies API (`/api/supplies?user_id={userId}`)
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: [supply1, supply2, ...], // Array of supply objects
  total: count,
  page: 1,
  limit: 10
}
```

### Farms API (`/api/farms?user_id={userId}`)
```javascript
{
  success: true,
  data: {
    farms: [farm1, farm2, ...], // Array of farm objects
    pagination: { ... }
  }
}
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Data Parsing in AdminPage.tsx
**File:** `src/pages/AdminPage.tsx`
**Lines:** 426-460

**Before:**
```typescript
setEquipment(equipData.data?.equipment || []);
setSupplies(supplyData.data?.supplies || []);
```

**After:**
```typescript
setEquipment(equipData.data || []);
setSupplies(supplyData.data || []);
```

### 2. Added Debugging and Error Handling
- Added console logging to track API responses
- Added error checking for API success status
- Improved error messages for debugging

### 3. Enhanced Modal Display
- Added more detailed information for equipment (type, price, availability)
- Added more detailed information for supplies (category, price, quantity, availability)
- Improved visual presentation of the data

## How to Test the Fix

### 1. Manual Testing
1. Log in as an admin user
2. Go to the Admin Dashboard
3. Find a user who has equipment or supplies
4. Click the "View Content" button (eye icon)
5. Verify that the modal shows the user's equipment and supplies

### 2. Console Debugging
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Click "View Content" for a user
4. Check the console logs for:
   - "Opening content modal for user: ..."
   - "Equipment API response: ..."
   - "Supplies API response: ..."
   - "Equipment data to set: ..."
   - "Supplies data to set: ..."

### 3. API Testing
Use the provided test script:
```bash
node test-admin-api.js
```

## Files Modified
1. `src/pages/AdminPage.tsx` - Fixed data parsing and enhanced display
2. `test-admin-api.js` - Created test script for API verification
3. `ADMIN_EQUIPMENT_SUPPLIES_FIX.md` - This documentation

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- When clicking "View Content" for a user with equipment, the modal should show:
  - Equipment name, type, price, and availability status
- When clicking "View Content" for a user with supplies, the modal should show:
  - Supply name, category, price, quantity, unit, and availability status
- If a user has no equipment or supplies, it should show "No equipment found" or "No supplies found"

## Troubleshooting
If the issue persists:
1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify that the backend server is running
3. Check that the user has the correct role permissions
4. Verify that the equipment/supplies are properly associated with the user in the database
5. Use the test script to verify API endpoints are working correctly
